### joke-me

A command-line tool that tells you a joke :boom:

**Install**

```
npm i -g joke-me

You gotta have at least `node v4.0.0` for this to work, cause ES6. **Pro Tip:** use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to quickly install/switch between different versions of node.


**Usage**

Dead simple all you gotta do is run:

```
joke-me
```

**Options**
```
-h, --help     output usage information
-V, --version  output the version number
-s, --sfw      tells a SFW joke
```
